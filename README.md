The purpose of this directory is to store PCB work and documentation on my first PCB design that was developed and sent to a fab house. While working on a team, I was tasked with designing the PCB layout for a Carrier Board that houses a CM4 module.
There are three versions of the PCB as we discovered issues and misleading information in the CM4 documentation such as camera pin layout. The final version worked and is in the primary CAD and schematic directory.

Version 2:
I2C lines for CAM1 are used for CAM0 which makes the camera a little finicky.

Version 3:
V3 fixes the issue with the camera and acts as a more ideal PCB.

After this project I have begun to focus more on the KiCAD software to design PCB fabs as a hobby due to the limitations of EAGLE only allowing 2 layers for the free version.
